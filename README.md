# Studio Workflow Automation

These series of projects are a culmination of lectures and assignments given during the course of the spring semester for COMP 467 - Multimedia Systems Design.

### Course Main Goals and Objectives
Additionally, these projects were assigned and distributed with the main course goals in mind:

* Get familiar with production coding (i.e scripting Python)
* Learn production environments and technology used.
* Maintain software quality and integrity
* Prepare for the real world
* Avoid Senioritis

### Takeaways from projects and course in general
  The course in general introduced ways to utilize Python for its scripting abilities. This includes processing text and video files, handling command-line arguments, parsing, and more. The course also introduced a basic level understanding of databases, from setting the databases up to performing CRUD operations.<br />
  
  Technology aside, we also learned the workflows that can be present in a studio environment, and how automation scripting can help solve workflow problems. For example, manually checking locations of files/folders across different storage spaces or assisting with more manual tasks like marking shots for editing are ways automation scripting can alleviate workflow problems among studio/facility environments.
